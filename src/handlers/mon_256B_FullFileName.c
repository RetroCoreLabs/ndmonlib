/*
 * MON 256B [DEABF/FullFileName]
 *
 * Returns a complete file name from an abbreviated one. The directory, the user,
 * the file name, the file type, and the version are returned.
 *
 * Parameters (ND-500 CALLG form - the default-file-type param 3 exists only on
 * the ND-100 form and is IGNORED on the ND-500; NC/linker call with 2 args):
 *   [I] AbbrevFileName (STRING): Abbreviated file name
 *   [O] FileName (STRING): Full file name output (apostrophe-terminated)
 *   [I] FileType (STRING, optional/ND-100 only): Default file type
 *
 * Return contract (carve 006-S3FS DEABF + NC-oracle tier3): on a name that
 * resolves to an existing file, write the expanded name and return SUCCESS; on
 * an unresolved name, set the K flag and return error 46 (056B NO SUCH FILE
 * NAME) - the exact code NC tests to decide whether to CREATE the file. A
 * pass-through echo that always succeeds silently breaks NC's create-if-missing.

     *
     *   1. B004D9E6-B004DA5B is the linker's GENERIC indirect MON trampoline
     *      (one `callg b.0x40,$N,...` per arity 1..6). It is not DEABF-specific,
     *      so it says nothing about this call's private convention.
     *   2. In that trampoline the if-k target is the ERROR arm:
     *        B004DBF1: w move b.0x44,b.0xC   <- returned W1 into the error slot
     *      while the fall-through (K clear) arm is the SUCCESS one:
     *        B004DBED: w stz b.0xC           <- error slot zeroed
     *      The wrapper at B004D8DE treats a NONZERO b.0xC as an error code.
     *
     * The OPEN-DOMAIN call site agrees and tests K directly with no masking:
     *   B0000A6D: call $0xFFFFFFFFF80000AE,$0x3   ; MON 256B DEABF
     *   B0000A76: if k go $0x3                    ; -> B0000A79 ... retk (error)
     *   B0000A78: ret                             ; K clear = success
     * With K=1 the linker took the error arm out of OPEN-DOMAIN and reported
     * "SINTRAN (0000:00)" even though every MON call had succeeded. The old K=1
     * was invisible at the LOAD site only because the companion I1=0 below makes
     * the error arm copy 0 into b.0xC, which the wrapper reads as "no error".
